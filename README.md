Welcome to a space where **web security is fun and easy to understand!**\
Here, I’ll guide you through common web vulnerabilities like **XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF,** and many more — explained in a way that feels more like a chill hangout than a boring lecture.

We’ll explore how these bugs work, why they’re dangerous, and look at real-world examples that anyone can follow. Whether you’re curious about **ethical hacking**, a student learning **cybersecurity**, or just a tech enthusiast who wants to know how hackers think, you’ll find **simple explanations, practical tips, and friendly guidance** here.

Let’s learn, hack (ethically), and grow together in the exciting world of **web security**!
