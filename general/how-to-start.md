# How to Start

Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I was a total newbie to hacking. I’d watch movies where hackers typed furiously and muttered “I’m in!” — but real-life cybersecurity felt intimidating. Then I discovered platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box , and everything changed. Turns out, learning to hack doesn’t require a dark basement or a hoodie. Just curiosity, patience, and the right tools. Here’s how _you_ can start your journey.

### Why Online Platforms? <a href="#f136" id="f136"></a>

Imagine learning to cook by _actually_ cooking, not just watching MasterChef. That’s what these platforms do. They give you safe, legal environments to break things, make mistakes, and learn. No jail time, no guilt. Just pure, addictive problem-solving.

### My Go-To Platforms (and How to Use Them) <a href="#id-72f7" id="id-72f7"></a>

#### 1. TryHackMe <a href="#id-0e0b" id="id-0e0b"></a>

I started here. Think of it as a “hacking kindergarten.”

* What’s great: Step-by-step tutorials. You’ll learn how to scan networks with Nmap, crack passwords, and even hack a fake bank website.
* Pro tip: Do the free “Intro to Cybersecurity” room first. It’s like training wheels for hacking.

#### 2. Hack The Box <a href="#efaf" id="efaf"></a>

This one’s for when you’re ready to level up.

* What’s great: Realistic machines (like vulnerable servers) that mimic real-world targets.
* My first win: I hacked into a Windows machine called _Blue_ by exploiting a printer service. Felt like a superhero.
* Warning: It’s addictive. You might lose sleep chasing that “Owned!” message.

#### 3. PicoCTF <a href="#id-9a0d" id="id-9a0d"></a>

If you love puzzles, this is your jam.

* What’s great: Designed for beginners, with challenges like decoding secret messages or finding hidden files.
* Fun fact: I once solved a crypto puzzle by Googling “how to read a binary file” — and felt like a genius.

#### 4. OverTheWire <a href="#id-9c10" id="id-9c10"></a>

For command-line warriors. No GUIs, just you and the terminal.

* What’s great: Teaches Linux skills and scripting. The _Bandit_ series starts with simple password hunts and gets progressively trickier.
* My struggle: I spent hours stuck on Level 3 until I learned about `grep`. Now it’s my favorite tool.

### How I Practice (Without Getting Overwhelmed) <a href="#e559" id="e559"></a>

1. Start Small, Think Big\
   Don’t jump into hacking the Pentagon. Begin with basic Linux commands or simple web apps. I spent weeks just learning `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` on OverTheWire.
2. Write Everything Down\
   Keep a journal (digital or paper) of commands, mistakes, and “aha!” moments. Mine’s full of scribbles like:\
   &#xNAN;_“Nmap -sV scans services. Why didn’t I think of that sooner?”_
3. Steal from the Best\
   Stuck? Read write-ups (like [CTF Time ](https://ctftime.org/)) to see how others solved the challenge. Then try it yourself.
4. Join the Community\
   I lurked on Hack The Box’s Discord for months before asking questions. Now I help newbies too. Pro tip: People love sharing hints — just don’t ask for spoilers!

### Mistakes I Made (So You Don’t Have To) <a href="#d81d" id="d81d"></a>

* Skipping the Basics\
  Tried hacking a web app without knowing HTTP basics. Spent days on a SQL injection that _should’ve_ taken minutes. Learn HTTP first.
* Relying on Tools\
  Used tools like sqlmap before understanding how SQLi works. Now I try to do things manually first.
* Ignoring Write-Ups\
  Finished a challenge, felt proud… then realized I’d missed a smarter solution. Always review after solving.

### What’s Next? <a href="#f3a5" id="f3a5"></a>

Once you’re comfortable on these platforms:

* Build a Home Lab: Use VirtualBox to practice attacking old Windows VMs.
* Compete in CTFs: Join events like [CTFTime ](https://ctftime.org/)to test your skills against others.
* Get Certified: Try the [eJPT ](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ejpt/)or [OSCP ](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)for street cred.

### Final Thoughts <a href="#d5b0" id="d5b0"></a>

Hacking isn’t about being a genius. It’s about persistence. Some days you’ll feel like a wizard; other days, you’ll Google “how to unzip a file” (yes, I’ve been there). But every challenge you solve makes you sharper.

So pick a platform, embrace the suck, and remember: The only bad question is the one you don’t ask.

_Now go break some stuff (legally) happy hacking ._ 💻✨
